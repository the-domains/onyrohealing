# Vibration and frequencies

I work with vibration and different frequencies. as Human beings we are like antennas we can receive and transmit vibration and different frequencies. each emotion and thought have a specific frequency. The Way the Healing occurs is when you raise your frequency high enough to reach the next level cap. where it can't go down anymore.. that is how you gain a permanent healing. 

I tap into these new type of healing frequencies, where they guide me to give you the exact healing you need. I don't heal the symptom i raise your vibration to the next level cap where the Symptom/pain just disappears. 

Everyone has access to these healing frequencies and they are not something special. you just need to develop a type of sensitivity to it. and play and have fun with it. 

Traps I've learned on the way. Don't use the Frequencies to Mask the pain while you continue going the wrong way. When the frequencies get weaker and your trying to get them raise, your to much in your comfort zone, do something new. something that you would never do. Do not use the frequencies to make yourself feel good as a confidence booster. the abilities are not yours.. you are an antenna and a receiver. 

you can never master the frequencies. always stay in a state of wonderment and discovery. 

One Way of thanking the Healing is to believe that whatever happened Happened and continue on your path. and the job has been done.
