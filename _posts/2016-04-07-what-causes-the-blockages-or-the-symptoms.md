# what causes the blockages.. or the symptoms..

emotional blockages happen when you hold on to a negative emotion. and we hold on to them because we Do Not want to feel that way.

when your saying to a specific emotion hat you don't want to feel that way you are associating yourself as that emotion.. that you ARE angry , or you ARE sad.. i am a sad person or i am an anxious person.. Unlike when we feel joy or happiness or gratitude.. we don't associate with ourselves,, We will be happy in the moment and but we will not say i am a happy person.. we will not say I'm a grateful person.. 

that creates the feeling to stay inside of us.. and create blockages.. Even happy feelings can cause blockages... have you ever been to excited that you go and do something stupid right after? because you were not grounded enough to take  a good look?? that creates a different form of blockage.
