# My Story.

I first started learning this through my friend Alex Tchaparian. One day he came to work on my lower back as a massage therapist, than he said i want to try something new, he started waving his hands around my lower back area, after like 5 min of doing that he told me to test my lower back and see if it hurts... I tried and Guess what.. it was Healed !!! I was super Excited ! i didn't know what happened.. but all i knew is that i had to learn how to do that. and so our journey began. he became like a mentor to me and he showed me how to tap into these frequencies. after 7 years of learning. We also did a seminar called recollective healing which helped me learn the frequencies that we were using a bit more. When people ask me whats the name of your technique... to be honest there is no Name for it.. cause its Not a technic.. Eric Pearl calls it the Recollective Healing.. But i guess we can use that name to call the frequencies we Tap into.  Recollective Healing Frequencies. And we just Tap into it to play in it and to be guided by it.  

We are not the healers, We just tap into and receive whatever we need to receive so that a Healing can take place. it might come in many different ways and forms. it might not come in the way you or I expect it. It Can and most of the time it does. But know that you will Receive exactly what you need !
