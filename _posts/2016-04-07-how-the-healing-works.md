# How the healing works..

how are the raising of the vibration happening? how come waving my hands around you create a raising of vibration?? 

we can not really explain this part.. there have been scientific experiments that something happens during the healings. How is it possible? We don't know.. even if everything is energy, everything has a vibration and frequency, how are we tapping into these frequencies? who is the crazy person that just tried waving his hands around a person and that a healing happened... something happened and there is a reason why energetic treatments have been around for 1000s of years.. there must be something there.. 

I myself am in the process of using Neurofeedback and biofeedback to see what happens to the brainwaves when someone is being healed by these healing frequencies  and on myself to see what happens to me when taping into and playing with the frequencies.
