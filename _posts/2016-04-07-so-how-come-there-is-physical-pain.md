# SO how come there is physical pain?? 

I don't have the scientific version but i do have the energetic version, (spiritual) 

All symptoms and pains comes from a choice that you took somewhere or sometime in your life. ( I'm not talking about the people who are born with a certain type of disease or illness) I'm talking about the people who were born completely healthy,,, but with the decisions they have made or that accidents that have happened to them.. 

how do we make certain choices? why did we choose a path over the other? normally its because of the state that you are in. maybe if you were in a different state you would have made a different decision.. you wouldn't have picked that job.. you wouldn't have picked that relation ship... you wouldn't have decided to go to that certain place.. we create our illness we create our symptoms through the state that we are in.. be in a better state you will take a better choice.. take a better choice and you will have a better result.. where you will be healthy.. successful and happy. 

there are some actions that we don't know of their existence,, so how do we take actions that don't even know exist?

children that want to take different actions that don't know of a way out of their toxic home environment. 

people that want better jobs that don't know how to get out of that situation.. 

What can they do? 

They are Trapped... They are trapped behind a very annoying trap.. the trap of i don't want to do anything to make my life better.. the trap of i don't deserve better than this.. this is hidden from ourselves and if it were easy to see you would start taking action.. the human mind and psychic is created with full of creative ideas and intuition to find new ideas and actions filled power and knowledge.. if you have no idea what actions to take. it means your being stopped by certain blockages, beliefs. and past stories. 

What the energetic treatments do is that it raises the energy level of your mind, emotions, physical body and your life energetic field. 

with it comes a coaching session that provides you with the knowledge to be able to see what is in your way so that you can shed some light on to that area of life.
